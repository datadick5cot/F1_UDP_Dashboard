# 🏎️ Raspberry Pi UDP Telemetry Reader for 🏁 F1 Games

Welcome to the **UDP Telemetry Reader** project — a lightweight and powerful tool designed to run on a **Raspberry Pi 🍓**, built to capture and process real-time telemetry data from the **F1 🏎️** game series using the **UDP** data stream!  

This project lets you tap into your favorite racing simulator’s live data — like speed, throttle, brake, and lap times — to create your own dashboards, LEDs, or motion setups for ultimate immersion!  

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Reads **UDP** telemetry packets from **F1 🏎️** (by Codemasters / EA Sports)  
✅ Lightweight and runs smoothly on **Raspberry Pi 🍓**  
✅ Built entirely in **Python 🐍**  
✅ Modular design for easy customization  
✅ Real-time data visualization and logging support  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The **F1 🏎️** game broadcasts live telemetry data over **UDP**.  
Your **Raspberry Pi 🍓** listens to these packets, decodes them using **Python 🐍**, and processes the data for use in your own applications (e.g., dashboards, LEDs, or web overlays).
